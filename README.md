# SONAR ROCK VS MINE PREDICTION 

## Train a model to identify if the sonar wave bounced off a rock or mine in the ocean.


Sonar (sound navigation and ranging) is a technique based on the principle of reflection of ultrasonic sound waves. These waves propagate through water and reflect on hitting the ocean bed or any object obstructing its path.
Sonar has been widely used in submarine navigation, communication with or detection of objects on or under the water surface (like other vessels), hazard identification, etc.
There are two types of sonar technology used â€” passive (listening to the sound emitted by vessels in the ocean) and active (emitting pulses and listening for their echoes).
It is important to note that research shows the use of active sonar can cause mass strandings of marine animals.
